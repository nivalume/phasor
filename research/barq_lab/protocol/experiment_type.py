"""The plug-in boundary between the research protocol and a kind of experiment.

The protocol (cards, registration, ledger counts, gate thresholds, OOS batches,
forward tracking) is the same for every type. A type decides what a spec looks
like, how one run executes, which perturbations it reports, and which of its
numbers the gate judges. Only `factor_ts` exists; add a type when a card needs one.
