//! Record schemas: the contract between the two tiers.
//!
//! The vectorized tier and the phase-2 event-driven tier compute completely
//! differently and will never share a simulation loop. What they do share is
//! this: **the same records come out**. Unifying the output rather than the
//! computation is the whole architecture — it means the analysis layer is
//! written once and works on either tier's results, and it means a
//! vectorized sweep and an event-driven replay can be compared column by
//! column.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! Records are struct-of-arrays, not array-of-structs, so they hand off to
//! Arrow without a transpose and so that a query touching one field does not
//! pull the other six through cache.
//!
//! # Ordering and identity
//!
//! Records are emitted in column-major order — all of column 0's fills, then
//! all of column 1's — and `id` is the record's position in the merged array.
//! That is what makes a parallel simulation reproducible: each column fills
//! its own buffer with no shared counter, the buffers are concatenated in
//! column order, and ids are assigned afterwards. A shared atomic counter
//! would make ids depend on thread interleaving.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Phase 1. Order records, all three trade views, drawdown episodes, the
//! mapped-array reduction layer and log records are implemented.
