//! Cash that moved without a fill.
//!
//! The analysis layer rebuilds every balance from records alone. Fills used to be the only thing that moved
//! cash, so order records were enough. A deposit, an interest payment or a
//! fee charged on a schedule changes the balance without a fill, and the
//! amount actually applied is path-dependent — a withdrawal is capped at the
//! free cash the account has on that bar — so it cannot be recomputed from the
//! inputs afterwards. It has to be recorded, like a fill.
//!
//! These records travel inside [`OrderRecords`](crate::OrderRecords) as its
//! `cash` field, so every sink, merge and constructor that already carries a
//! run's fills carries its cash flows too.
