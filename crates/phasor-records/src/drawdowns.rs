//! Drawdowns as records, not as a single number.
//!
//! `phasor_analysis::metrics::max_drawdown` answers "how bad did it get". That
//! is one number out of a series that contained a dozen separate episodes, and
//! it says nothing about how long any of them lasted or whether the strategy
//! ever came back. A record per episode does: each one carries its peak, its
//! valley, where it ended and whether it recovered, so a column's drawdown
//! history reduces through the ordinary [`crate::mapped`] machinery like any
//! other record set.
//!
//! # Four indices, and only three of them are obvious
//!
//! ```text
//!        peak
//!         │ start = peak + 1
//!         ▼ ▼
//!   ──────●───────────────────●──────
//!          ╲                 ╱
//!           ╲               ╱
//!            ╲─────●───────╱
//!                  ▲       ▲
//!               valley    end
//! ```
//!
//! `peak_idx` is the last bar *before* the decline, and `start_idx` is the
//! first bar of the decline itself — always `peak_idx + 1`, stored anyway
//! because the two measure different things. Duration from the peak includes
//! the flat bar at the top; duration from the start does not, and that is the
//! one the decline phase is measured over.
//!
//! # A drawdown that never recovered is still a record
//!
//! The last episode in a column usually has not recovered, and it is marked
//! [`DrawdownStatus::Active`] with `end_idx` at the last bar reached. Its
//! recovery duration is therefore a lower bound and its recovery return is
//! whatever it had clawed back so far. Averaging active and recovered
//! episodes together is the standard way to understate how long recovery
//! takes — which is why the status is a field rather than a detail.
