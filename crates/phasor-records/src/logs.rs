//! Log records: the full before-and-after of one order.
//!
//! Order records say what happened. A log says what was *asked for* and what
//! the account looked like on both sides of the answer — which is the only
//! thing that answers the question people actually have when a backtest
//! surprises them: **why did this bar not trade?**
//!
//! Without logs the available evidence is that no order record exists, which
//! is consistent with a dozen causes: the size resolved to zero, the cash ran
//! out, the granularity floored it away, the direction forbade it, the price
//! was `NaN`. With a log the reason is a field.
//!
//! # Why this is off by default
//!
//! A log is 38 fields against an order record's 7, and it is written for every
//! order *considered* rather than every order filled — on a sparse strategy
//! that is twenty times as many rows at five times the width. On a
//! thousand-column sweep that is gigabytes for something nobody will read.
//!
//! So logging is per order, through the request's own `log` flag, and it is a
//! [`FlexArray`](phasor_core::flex::FlexArray) like every other parameter. The
//! useful shapes are: off everywhere (the default), on for one column being
//! investigated, or on for one row across a sweep.
//!
//! # The `id` fields
//!
//! `id` is the record's index, as everywhere else here. `order_id` points at
//! the order record this log produced, or `-1` when nothing filled — which is
//! the join between the two sets, and the reason a rejected order still gets
//! a row.
//!
//! # Two logs are rarely `==`
//!
//! [`LogRecords`] derives `PartialEq`, and it is a trap: a rejected order fills
//! nothing, so its `res_size`, `res_price` and `res_fees` are `NaN` — and
//! `NaN != NaN`. Any run that rejected anything therefore compares unequal to
//! *itself*. Compare the `Debug` rendering, or the fields that matter, when
//! what is wanted is "the same log twice".
//!
//! **`order_id` is relative to the buffer it was written into, and is re-based
//! when buffers merge.** That is the same rule `id` follows, and for the same
//! reason: a simulation that wrote global ids would need a shared counter, and
//! then the numbering would depend on how threads interleaved. [`Journal`]
//! owns both halves of a run, so [`Journal::concat`] is the one place that
//! knows a chunk's order offset — which is why merging goes through it rather
//! than concatenating the two record sets separately.
