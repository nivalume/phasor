//! Counter-based random numbers: every draw is a pure function of its key.
//!
//! A stream generator makes each draw depend on every draw before it, so the
//! answer would change with the order columns are visited in, the number of
//! threads, or a column added in front. Here a draw is computed from
//! `(seed, row, col)`, plus a `salt` when one cell needs several independent
//! draws. Column `c` comes out the same whether it is generated alone or as
//! the thousandth of a sweep, and serial and threaded runs stay bit-identical.
//!
//! [`bits`] chains SplitMix64's [`mix`] over the key. Two maps turn those bits
//! into a uniform, and both are kept because existing results depend on each:
//!
//! - [`to_unit`] on `[0, 1)`. [`uniform`] is this map over the unsalted key:
//!   `phasor-sim` draws `reject_prob` with it and `phasor-signals` draws the
//!   random signals with it.
//! - [`to_unit_nonzero`] on `(0, 1]`, never zero, so a logarithm of it is
//!   finite. `phasor-generic` draws its synthetic paths with it, one salt per
//!   draw.
//!
//! The draws are not cryptographic and are not meant to match NumPy's stream.
//! A seed names one answer: changing anything here changes every seeded result
//! downstream, which the pinned tests in this module and in the three crates
//! above catch.
