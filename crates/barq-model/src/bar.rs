//! Bar / OHLCV data.
//!
//! Phase 1 is bar-only by design (see `docs/01-architecture.md`). The
//! vectorized tier reads OHLCV as four parallel column-major `f64` arrays
//! rather than as a `Bar` struct per row — a struct-of-arrays layout, because
//! the stop engine touches `open`, `high` and `low` in separate passes and an
//! array-of-structs layout would pull the whole row into cache for each.
//!
//! The [`Bar`] struct exists for the phase-2 event-driven tier, where a
//! strategy's `on_bar` needs one bar at a time.
