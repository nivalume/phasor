//! Reproducible random draws for `reject_prob`.
//!
//! The execution kernel never draws a random number itself: the caller passes
//! the draw in. A shared generator advanced by
//! the loop would make each draw depend on how many came before it, which
//! depends on the grouping and the thread count. A draw computed from
//! `(seed, row, col)` alone depends on neither, so a run is reproducible and
//! its parallel and serial results stay identical.

/// A draw from `[0, 1)` for one order: column `col`, bar `row`.
///
/// [`phasor_core::random::uniform`], which a custom loop can call to reject
/// the same orders. Kept out of line: the loops reach it only when
/// `reject_prob > 0`, so it does not belong in their hot path.
