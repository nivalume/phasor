//! User code inside the bar loop: callbacks for `from_orders` and
//! `from_signals`.
//!
//! A callback is not an event handler. The loop is the same bar-by-bar loop,
//! with the same kernel and the same records; a callback is called at fixed
//! points of each bar and may change what the loop would have done there:
//!
//! | `from_orders` ([`OrderFunc`]) | `from_signals` ([`SignalFunc`]) | Called |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`pre_group`](OrderFunc::pre_group) | [`pre_group`](SignalFunc::pre_group) | once per group, before its first bar; returns the group's state |
//! | [`pre_segment`](OrderFunc::pre_segment) | | each bar, after prices, liquidation and the group's value, before any order |
//! | | [`adjust`](SignalFunc::adjust) | each bar and column, before its stops are tested |
//! | [`order`](OrderFunc::order) or [`flex_order`](OrderFunc::flex_order) | [`signals`](SignalFunc::signals) | each column's order (or signals and size) for the bar |
//! | [`post_order`](OrderFunc::post_order) | [`post_order`](SignalFunc::post_order) | after each order executes, filled or not |
//! | [`post_segment`](OrderFunc::post_segment) | [`post_segment`](SignalFunc::post_segment) | each bar, after earnings and holding charges |
//!
//! Each group gets its own state (`State`), made by `pre_group` and handed
//! back with the records, in group order. The callback itself is shared
//! (`&self`) and must be `Sync` for the parallel entry points; groups run in
//! parallel as they do without callbacks, so anything a callback shares
//! across groups needs [`Schedule::RowWise`](crate::from_orders::Schedule::RowWise).
//!
//! A callback reads the account through a [`Context`] and changes it only
//! through orders: everything that moves cash or a position still goes
//! through the kernel and into the records.
//!
//! # Cost when unused
//!
//! The loops are generic over the callback. [`NoCallbacks`] sets `ON` to
//! false, and every call site is behind `if C::ON`, so the copy the plain
//! entry points run has no code for any of it.
