//! `simulate_from_orders`: one order per element.
//!
//! The simplest of the vectorized loops. Every element of the target shape
//! becomes an order request; what comes out is a set of fills.
//!
//! # Groups, and where the sequential dependency lives
//!
//! By default every column is its own group and carries its own cash, which
//! is what makes a sweep embarrassingly parallel. With [`Groups`] a set of
//! columns can instead share one balance — a portfolio over several
//! instruments rather than several independent backtests — and then the
//! columns inside a group are executed in sequence within each bar, because
//! each fill changes what the next can afford.
//!
//! The parallel axis therefore moves from column to group. Groups stay
//! independent of one another, so nothing else about the decomposition
//! changes; a single grouped portfolio simply has one unit of work. See
//! [`crate::groups`].

/// not follow it, because `sink` is written in the execution order but each
/// record carries its own column and the caller sorts by column. See the note
/// on ordering in [`phasor_records`].
/// `fills` counts the fills already written to `sink`, and is advanced here.
/// It belongs to the caller rather than to this function because a log's
/// `order_id` is an index into the buffer it was written to, and the serial
