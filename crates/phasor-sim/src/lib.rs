//! Vectorized simulation loops, and where parallelism happens.
//!
//! # Account groups are independent
//!
//! Order and signal loops share capital inside each group. Groups own their
//! state and execute in parallel; symbols within a group execute sequentially.
//! With no sharing, each column is its own account.
//!
//! This is what the reference event-driven engine cannot do: it holds its
//! state in `Rc<RefCell<..>>` behind a process-global message bus, so its
//! sweep is a sequential `for` loop and users are told to run multiple
//! processes. Keeping every engine instance `Send`, with no global state, is
//! a hard constraint on this codebase.
//!
//! [`from_orders::simulate_from_orders_parallel`] returns records equal to the
//! serial version for the same input, whatever the thread count. That is not
//! incidental: each column fills its own buffer and record ids are assigned
//! after merging in column order, so nothing depends on how threads
//! interleave.
//!
//! # Why this loop is not SIMD
//!
//! Along the time axis there is a hard loop-carried dependency:
//! `state[i] = f(state[i-1], bar[i])`. Across columns, SIMD is possible in
//! principle and a bad trade in practice — the execution kernel is a deep
//! branch tree with fourteen data-dependent early exits, and lanes would
//! diverge on nearly every bar. SIMD belongs in the factor and analysis
//! layers, where the operations have no such dependency. The two techniques
//! stack; they are not alternatives.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Phase 1, stage 3, done: `from_orders`, `from_signals` with its seven-step
//! signal pipeline and stop engine, cash sharing with the automatic call
//! order, and a logged variant of each loop.
//!
//! Cash sharing arrived after the rest, and moved the unit of parallel work
//! from the column to the group. With the default grouping the two are the
//! same thing, so nothing changed for independent symbols; with one shared
//! portfolio there is a single unit of work, which is inherent — a shared cash
//! balance is a sequential dependency across the whole group.
