//! Maintenance margin and liquidation.
//!
//! An exchange closes a margin position once the account can no longer carry
//! it: when its equity falls below the maintenance margin of its positions.
//! The loops test every account once per bar, after the bar's prices are
//! resolved and its margin columns settled, before any order is valued or
//! placed, so a position is tested from the bar after it opened — as a stop
//! is.
//!
//! # The test
//!
//! Each column holding a position is given a path through the bar: from its
//! *start*, the bar's open, to its *check* price, the `mark_price` where there
//! is one and otherwise the bar's adverse extreme — the low for a long, the
//! high for a short. Along the paths, moved together by a fraction `α` from 0
//! to 1, the account's equity and its maintenance requirement are both linear
//! in `α`:
//!
//! ```text
//! E(α) = cash + Σ (position × p(α) − owed)
//! M(α) = Σ maintenance_margin × |position| × p(α)       (notional)
//!      + Σ maintenance_margin × |position|              (per unit)
//! ```
//!
//! If `E(1) ≥ M(1)` the account survives the bar. Otherwise it is liquidated
//! where it first breached: at `α = E(0) − M(0)` over `(E(0) − M(0)) − (E(1) −
//! M(1))`, or at the open (`α = 0`) when it was already breached there, the
//! gap a stop fills at too. With one position this is the textbook
//! liquidation price, and the path through the bar is what makes the fill
//! price exact rather than the bar's extreme.
//!
//! Without a mark price every column is tested at its own extreme, which
//! treats a hedge as if both legs could move against the account at once: a
//! spot long and a perpetual short reach their lows and highs at different
//! times. A hedged account wants a mark price — the close, if nothing else —
//! which puts every column at one instant.
//!
//! In `from_signals`, a stop that fires on the bar was hit on the way to the
//! extreme: its column is checked at the less adverse of its check price and
//! the stop's level, so a stop inside the liquidation price closes the
//! position first, and one beyond it does not save it.
//!
//! # Cross and isolated
//!
//! A **cross** margin column shares the account's equity: the test above runs
//! over the account, with every cross column that carries a maintenance margin
//! closed together, in layout order, at its own point of the path. Cash
//! columns count in the equity and are never closed: they are collateral.
//!
//! An **isolated** column carries only its own margin. It is not settled into
//! the account's cash each bar, so its profit or loss is its own, and it is
//! tested alone: `E(α) = locked_cash + position × p(α) − owed`. Its margin is
//! all it can lose. The account's test leaves it out, margin and position
//! both.
//!
//! # Tiers
//!
//! An exchange's maintenance margin rises with the position's size. With
//! `maintenance_margin_tiers`, a column's requirement is read from a table of
//! notional bounds and rates instead of `maintenance_margin`: the rate of the
//! tier the notional falls in, less the amount that keeps the requirement
//! continuous at the bounds,
//!
//! ```text
//! M = rate_t × notional − amount_t,   amount_t = amount_{t−1} + bound_{t−1} × (rate_t − rate_{t−1})
//! ```
//!
//! which is piecewise linear along the path, so the breach is found by
//! bisection rather than the closed form.
//!
//! # Partial liquidation
//!
//! With `liquidation_step` below 1, a breach closes that fraction of each
//! position that carries a maintenance margin, at the breach, and the test
//! goes on along the rest of the bar's path with what is left; each later
//! breach closes the same fraction again. After 64 steps, or once a position
//! is smaller than a millionth of where it started, what is left is closed
//! in full.
//!
//! # Auto-deleveraging
//!
//! An exchange whose insurance fund cannot cover a bankrupt account closes
//! profitable positions on the other side. That is not something one account's
//! own prices decide, so it is given: `auto_deleverage` marks the bars on which
//! a margin column's position, if it is in profit at the mark price (the close
//! without one), is closed there with no fee, flagged as a liquidation.
//!
//! # What a liquidation leaves behind
//!
//! The fill is an order record like any other, with `fees` at
//! `liquidation_fee` of its notional, flagged as a liquidation in the records
//! and the logs. A liquidation that leaves an isolated column's margin
//! negative, or a cross account with no cross or cash position left and less
//! cash than its isolated positions' margin, is a loss the account cannot
//! pay: the exchange's insurance fund takes it. That write-off is a
//! [`CashFlowKind::Liquidation`] record, positive, booked to the isolated
//! column or to the account's first column.
