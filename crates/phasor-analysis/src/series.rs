//! The lazy rebuild chain: records back to a value curve.
//!
//! A portfolio stores its order records, the close prices and the starting
//! cash. Everything else is derived on demand through this chain:
//!
//! ```text
//! records ──▶ asset_flow ──▶ assets ─┐
//!         └─▶ cash_flow  ──▶ cash  ──┴─▶ value ──▶ returns
//!                                          ▲
//!                                     close prices
//! ```
//!
//! Storing the chain instead would mean holding six full matrices per sweep
//! when most columns are only ever asked for one scalar. Rebuilding is cheap
//! — one pass over the records plus one over the bars — and the arrays are
//! the largest thing in the system.
//!
//! Every function here takes records in the engine's ordering: grouped by
//! column, ascending in row within a column.
