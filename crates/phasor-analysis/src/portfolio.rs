//! The result of a run, and everything derivable from it.
//!
//! Before this type, a caller who wanted a statistics table had to assemble
//! the rebuild chain by hand: assets, then cash flow, then cash, then asset
//! value, then value, then returns, then trades, then drawdowns, then one
//! `StatsInput` per column. That was eighty-odd lines, it appeared verbatim in
//! three places, and nothing checked the order or the arguments — passing the
//! order price where the close belongs produces a plausible equity curve that
//! is wrong.
//!
//! # Only four things are stored
//!
//! Order records, the close prices, the starting cash and the shape.
//! Everything else is derived on demand and cached. For a sweep that is the
//! difference between holding one array per column and holding a dozen, and
//! most columns in a sweep are never asked for more than a single scalar.
//!
//! The cache is [`OnceLock`], not a `RefCell`, so a `Portfolio` stays `Sync`
//! and several threads can compute different columns' metrics from one
//! portfolio. That matters for the same reason the simulator's state is
//! thread-local: the whole design is built on being able to fan out.
//!
//! # What it borrows
//!
//! Prices are borrowed, not copied. A sweep's close matrix is the largest
//! thing in the system and there is no reason for the result of a run to own
//! a second copy of it.
//!
//! # Account groups
//!
//! Positions and trades remain per symbol. Cash, value and return metrics
//! follow cash-sharing groups, with initial capital counted once per group.
