//! Cash that enters or leaves an account without a fill.
//!
//! Two inputs, both shared by the order and signal loops:
//!
//! | Input | Booked | Read at | Recorded as |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `cash_deposits` | at the bar's open, before any order is sized | the group's first column | [`CashFlowKind::Deposit`] |
//! | `cash_dividends` | at the bar's open, after the deposit | each column, times the position held | [`CashFlowKind::Dividend`] |
//! | `cash_earnings` | at the bar's close, after every order | each column | [`CashFlowKind::Earning`] |
//!
//! A deposit lands before the bar is valued, so a target-sized order on the
//! same bar already counts it: that is what lets a recurring deposit be
//! invested by the rebalance it arrives with. An earning lands after the
//! orders, so it is part of the bar's return and of the next bar's sizing.
//!
//! **A negative amount is capped at the free cash available**, never taking
//! the account below zero: a withdrawal or a cost the account cannot pay is
//! applied in part. The record holds the amount actually applied, which is
//! why the cap needs no second source of truth — the analysis layer rebuilds
//! the balance from what was booked, not from what was asked.
//!
//! `NaN` means no flow, as a `NaN` size means no order. An infinite amount is
//! an error: there is no finite balance it could produce.
