/// Account state that an order execution reads and rewrites.
///
/// `debt`, `locked_cash` and `free_cash` are the fields that are easy to get
/// wrong.
///
/// - `cash` is the account's own cash. Borrowed money is not in it: a
///   leveraged buy spends own cash only for the part it does not borrow.
/// - `debt` is what the column owes. On a short it is the proceeds of the
///   open short sales, held at their average entry price — what the short
///   "owes" back. On a leveraged long it is the money borrowed to buy it.
/// - `locked_cash` is the own cash the position ties up. On a long it is the
///   own part of what was paid for it, already gone from `cash`. On a short it
///   is the collateral, `value / leverage` at entry, still in `cash` but not
///   free.
/// - `free_cash` is own cash net of what open shorts tie up: their proceeds
///   and their collateral. Opening or extending a short moves it by
///   `proceeds - short_value - short_value / leverage`; at leverage 1 that is
///   the reference's `proceeds - 2 * short_value`, once for the position's own
///   value and once for the round-trip reservation. Closing unwinds it
///   through `(debt + locked_cash) / |position|`.
///
/// Without leverage a long has no debt and a short's `locked_cash` equals its
/// `debt`, which is the only state the reference can describe.
///
/// A margin column ([`AccountType::Margin`]) reads the same fields
/// differently, on both sides alike: `debt` is the position's cost basis,
/// `|position|` times its average entry price, which the loop moves to the
/// valuation price as it settles each bar's profit into `cash`; `locked_cash`
/// is the initial margin posted, still in `cash` but not free. So `free_cash`
/// is `cash` less the margin of every margin position, and less the
/// reservations of any cash column's shorts in the same group.
///
/// Carrying only `cash` and `position` and deriving the rest does not work —
/// the reservation is path-dependent.
