//! Sequence-level golden test: chain orders and compare at every step.
//!
//! The single-call harness (`golden.rs`) pins down one `execute_order`
//! invocation. It cannot see anything that only goes wrong when state is
//! threaded from one call to the next.
//!
//! **The replay feeds its own outputs forward.** It reads the initial cash from
//! the fixture and nothing else: every subsequent state comes from our kernel,
//! not from the expected column. Re-seeding from the fixture each step would
//! turn this back into the single-call test, because a drift introduced at
//! step 2 would be wiped before step 3 could amplify it.
//!
//! Chaining rule, as the fixture was recorded:
//!
//! ```text
//! state = flat(init_cash)
//! for each step i:
//!     val_price = fixture's val_price for the step
//!     value     = state.cash + state.position * val_price
//!     state, result = execute_order(state, order[i])
//! ```
//!
//! `val_price` and `value` are not kernel outputs — a simulation loop derives
//! them from the bar — so the rule is fixed on both sides.
