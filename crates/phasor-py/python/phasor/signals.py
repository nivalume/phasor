"""Signals: random baselines, cleaning, generated exits, ranges, ranks,
calendar signals and a summary table.

A strategy whose entries beat :func:`random_n` entries with the same count
has an entry rule; one that does not has a sample.

Every draw is a function of ``(seed, row, col)`` alone, not of a random
stream: the same seed gives the same signals, bit for bit, and a column's
signals do not change when other columns are generated beside it. They are
not NumPy's draws and do not try to be.

``shape`` is ``n`` for one 1-D series or ``(n_rows, n_cols)`` for a panel.
