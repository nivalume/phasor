"""Synthetic prices with known properties, to build controls with.

A backtest on real prices cannot tell a strategy that found an edge from one
that fit the noise, because the true process is unknown. A :func:`gbm` with
``mu=0`` has no edge by construction, so a strategy that reports a healthy
Sharpe on it is measuring its own overfitting. These exist to build that
control, not to model a market.

Every draw is a function of ``(seed, row, col)``: the same arguments give the
same path bit for bit, and column ``c`` does not depend on how many columns
were asked for. ``shape`` is ``n`` for one 1-D series or ``(n_rows, n_cols)``
for independent paths side by side.
