"""Simulating on finer bars than the signals were computed on.

A stop tested on hourly bars cannot tell whether the bar reached its
stop-loss or its take-profit first; on minute bars it can. The engine runs on
whatever bars it is given and has no timestamps, so the two resolutions meet
here:

- :func:`align` puts values computed on coarse bars onto fine bars, each at
  the first fine bar at or after the moment the coarse value became
  available — its bar's close, or ``ts_init``. Pass the times the values
  became known, not the times their bars opened: an hourly bar labelled by
  its open would otherwise leak an hour.
- :func:`resample` aggregates a fine series — a value curve, returns, cash
  flows — back onto coarse bars, to read a fine simulation at the
  resolution it was decided on.

    Each row of ``values`` lands on the first row of ``target_time`` at or

    elsewhere, two that land on one bar OR-ed. Numbers land as they are, the
    later of two on one bar winning, and ``NaN`` elsewhere — or, with
    ``fill``, the last value that landed, as a level that holds until the
    next (a stop distance, a target size).
