"""Turning annual rates into the per-bar rates the engine charges.

The engine's holding charges — ``debt_rate``, ``borrow_rate`` and the
financing rates — take what one bar's holding costs, for the time until the
next bar, because the engine has no clock: a bar is an index. How much time a
bar covers is in the bars' timestamps, which only the caller has::

    idx = df.index                                # the bars' timestamps
    debt = phasor.rates.per_bar(0.06, idx)        # 6% a year, per bar
    pf = phasor.from_orders(close, size, leverage=2.0, debt_rate=debt)

A daily stock series charges Friday's bar for three days, the weekend
included, and a bar before a holiday for the holiday too; a crypto series that
trades around the clock charges every bar alike. The last bar covers no time
and charges nothing: the run ends at its close.

Funding needs no conversion. An exchange publishes the rate each funding time
settles at; put it on the bar whose close is that time and leave the other bars
``NaN``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    annual_rate
        A number, one value per bar ``(n_bars,)``, or a matrix
        ``(n_bars, n_cols)``. A ``(1, n_cols)`` row gives each column its own
        rate. ``NaN`` stays ``NaN``, which charges nothing.
    index
        The bars' timestamps, strictly increasing: a pandas ``DatetimeIndex``
        or a ``datetime64`` array.
    days_per_year
        The day count: 365 (the default) for crypto and sterling, 360 for most
        money-market rates in dollars and euros.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        ``(n_bars,)`` for a number or one value per bar, ``(n_bars, n_cols)``
        for a matrix.
