"""Trading sessions: which bars are inside one, and which end one.

An intraday strategy flattens before the close and does not trade outside
the session. The engine has no clock, so the session is a mask built here
from the bars' timestamps, in the exchange's time zone:

::

    inside = phasor.sessions.session_mask(times, "09:30", "16:00", tz="America/New_York")
    last = phasor.sessions.session_end(times, "09:30", "16:00", tz="America/New_York")
    pf = phasor.from_signals(close, entries & inside[:, None], exits, force_exit=last)

``force_exit`` closes the position on the session's last bar in place of
anything else ordered there. A bar is in the session when its timestamp's
local time of day is in ``[start, end)``; a session that ends before it
starts (``"18:00"`` to ``"17:00"``) runs overnight, and belongs to the day
it starts on. Which instant a bar's timestamp marks — its open or its close
— is the caller's: pass the one the session is meant to bound.
