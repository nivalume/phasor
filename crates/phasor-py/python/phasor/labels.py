"""Supervised-learning targets: forward returns, trend, triple-barrier and
zig-zag pivot labels.

**Every function here reads the future.** These are the ``y`` a model is
trained to predict: the value at bar ``t`` is computed from bars after ``t``.
None of them is a signal, and none may be fed to a simulation as entries,
exits or features — a backtest that does so is not optimistic, it is wrong.
Each function says how far ahead it looks, which is the gap a train/test
split must leave between its halves.

``close`` is ``(bars,)`` or ``(bars, columns)`` and the result has the same
shape. Columns never see each other: a label near the end of one column does
not borrow bars from the next.
