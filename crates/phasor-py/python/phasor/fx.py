"""Prices quoted in another currency than the account's.

The engine keeps one cash balance per account, in one currency, and every
price must be in it. An instrument quoted in another currency is brought in
by converting its prices with the exchange rate of each bar:

::

    close_usd = phasor.fx.convert(close_eur, eurusd)          # EUR stock, USD account
    pf = phasor.from_signals(close_usd, entries, exits)

For an asset bought outright with account currency (a share, an ETF, a
coin in a cash column) this is exact: the position is worth its price times
the rate, and both the asset's move and the currency's are in the result.

For a contract settled in its own currency (a future or CFD in a margin
column) the converted series marks the whole notional at each bar's rate,
whereas the exchange pays the profit in the quote currency and only that
profit is exposed to the rate. The difference is the rate's move times the
position's notional, small over short holdings; the account then also holds
no foreign cash, as a multi-currency account would.
