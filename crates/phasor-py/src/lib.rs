//! Python bindings for phasor.
//!
//! A thin shell, deliberately. The engine's own [`Portfolio`] already holds the
//! interesting design — lazy derivation, one cached rebuild chain, per-column
//! metrics — so this layer's whole job is to get NumPy's buffers in and results
//! out without copying and without lying about layout.
//!
//! ```python
//! import numpy as np, phasor
//!
//! pf = phasor.from_signals(close, entries, exits, init_cash=10_000, fees=0.001)
//! print(pf.stats())            # the 28-row table
//! sharpe = pf.sharpe_ratio()   # one value per column
//! ```
//!
//! # What is exposed, and what is not
//!
//! Both vectorized loops — `from_signals` and `from_orders` — the portfolio they
//! return, its metrics, its statistics table, its exposures and trade
//! excursions, and its order, trade and log records as NumPy arrays. Factor
//! expressions, Alpha158, and Alpha360 are exposed through the Python shell
//! over this module's compiled [`expr::PyFactorSet`]. Event studies,
//! overfitting statistics, labels, random signals and synthetic prices are in
//! [`research`].
//!
//! Not exposed yet: the rolling metrics, drawdown
//! records, and the indicator sweep. Each is a small addition on this
//! scaffolding, and none of them changes it.
//!
//! # Two things worth knowing before using it
//!
//! **Arrays must be column-major.** The engine is; NumPy is not by default.
//! The Python wrapper converts, and the Rust layer refuses anything it cannot
//! read correctly rather than reading it wrongly — see [`array`] for why that
//! is a refusal rather than a silent transpose.
//!
//! **A column that never traded has an infinite Sharpe.** That is the
//! reference's answer and it tops a naive ranking. `traded_only` masks those to
//! `NaN`, which every reduction skips.
//!
//! **`log=True` answers why a bar did not trade**, which no order record can:
//! absence of a fill is consistent with a dozen causes. It is off by default
//! because a log row is 38 fields written for every order *considered*.
