//! The execution parameters both entry points share.
//!
//! `from_orders` and `from_signals` differ in what drives them — an order per
//! element against a signal pipeline — and agree on everything the execution
//! kernel reads: how big, at what price, what it costs, what is refused. That
//! shared middle is a dozen parameters, each of which can arrive as a number, a
//! value per column or a full matrix.
//!
//! Collected here for one reason: the borrows have to outlive the call that
//! builds the [`FlexArray`](phasor_core::flex::FlexArray)s from them, so they must
//! live in the caller's own frame. A struct is how two call sites can share
//! them without either one duplicating a dozen `let` bindings — and without a
//! helper that returns the arrays, which cannot be written, because the arrays
//! borrow from values the helper would drop on return.
