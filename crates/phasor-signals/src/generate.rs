//! Generating signals: exits from entries, and alternating pairs.
//!
//! # The callback the reference cannot have
//!
//! The reference's generators take a *choice function*: given a window
//! `[from, to)` and a column, return the indices to fire on. It is the right
//! abstraction — a time-based exit, a stop-based exit and a random exit are
//! the same loop with different choices — and the reference's own Rust
//! backend cannot expose it, because a Numba callback does not cross into
//! native code. Its dispatcher refuses every callback-taking function.
//!
//! In Rust the callback is a generic parameter and monomorphizes away, so the
//! loop is written once and costs nothing. [`generate_exits`] takes one;
//! [`exit_after`] and [`exit_on`] are the two built on it.
//!
//! # `wait` is not a detail
//!
//! An exit generated on the same bar as its entry means a position that opens
//! and closes within one bar, which most data cannot support and most
//! backtests should not claim. `wait` defaults to 1 everywhere in the
//! reference for that reason, and 0 is allowed rather than encouraged.
